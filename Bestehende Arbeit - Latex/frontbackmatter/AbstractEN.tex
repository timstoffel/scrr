	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Increasing competition demands more flexibility from companies regarding the operation of their software products. Container virtualization is becoming increasingly popular caused by easy automatization processes. Docker is the most widely used solution for container operation. The change from virtual machines to containers creates new attack vectors. In order to increase security, further solutions have been developed since 2018.
	
	The goal of this thesis is a comparison of the candidates Kata Containers, gVisor and Nabla Container according to the method of decision analysis. The candidates are assessed in terms of performance, security and usability. For an evaluation of the performance the candidates are analyzed in various disciplines. The evaluation in the security area is done by checking how the alternatives counteract the threats of the OWASP Docker Top 10. In the usability area, compatibility with Docker and Kubernetes is considered. Finally, a recommendation for Kata Containers is made.
